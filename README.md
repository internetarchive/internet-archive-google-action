# Internet Archive Google Action [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/internetarchive/internet-archive-voice-apps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/internetarchive/internet-archive-voice-apps) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/yagyanshbhatia/internet-archive-voice-apps/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/yagyanshbhatia/internet-archive-voice-apps)

## Setup Instructions
See the developer guide and release notes at https://developers.google.com/actions/ for more details.

### Steps for testing with Google Assistant
#### Create and setup project in Actions Console
1. Use the [Actions on Google](https://console.actions.google.com/) Console to add a new project with a name of your choosing and click Create Project.
2. Click `skip` 
3. Go to actions under build, and click `Add your first action`
4. select custom intent, then `build`
#### Create Action for the project
1. Click `CREATE` (continued from above step)
2. Go to `settings` and click `export and import`, then click `restore from zip`.
3. zip the contents of `models/dialogflow/` and use that zip to restore the project. 
#### Run Local Server
Run server local with colorful logs
1. `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. `touch functions/.runtimeconfig.json` and add fake keys (temporary workaround) refer [this](https://github.com/internetarchive/internet-archive-voice-apps/issues/434#issuecomment-453114249)
2. `firebase init` (remove .firebaserc first)
3. `firebase use --add` (and choose your own firebase project)
4. `cd functions` and `npm install`
4. `DEBUG=ia:* npm start` 
#### Expose local server
To expose server to google assistant use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
its free plan should be enough.

To publish 5000 port use:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

you should find url `https://<id>.ngrok.io/`.

#### Connect webhook to dialogflow
Go to the fullfillment section of your dialogflow draft copy of our app and after that you should use this url:

```bash
https://<id>.ngrok.io/<your project name>/us-central1/assistant
```

### Setup Env

#### Options

 - profile performance of requests
   Env Variable: `PROFILE_REQUESTS=true` (`false` by default)
   `firebase functions:config:set performance.requests=true`

### How to make contributions?

:mag: get [one good first issue](https://github.com/internetarchive/internet-archive-google-action/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
assign yourself (if you have access) or write comment that you'd like to work on this issue.
That's help to prevent work overlapping.

_create git branch `feature/<name-of-feature>`, [more](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)_

:computer: working on it

_Use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for continuous checking of
your code quality and cover functionality by tests_

```
npm run mocha -- --watch
```

:coffee: Complete checking of code by run unit tests and code style checking

```
npm test
```

:star2: We follow [standard javascript code style](https://standardjs.com/).

_Automatic style fixing, it doesn't solve all problems but could be very helpful_

```
npm run lint -- --fix
```

:tada: Finally make Pull Request and give complete description what have you done
and link the addressed issue.

_Also it could be good practice to create your Pull Request earlier,
but add `WIP:` at the beginning of its name! This way other developers
could see what are you working right now._
